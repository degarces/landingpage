#The footer.jsx needs to feature the ThorneCheck logo, logo.svg and needs to feature the socials X, Linkedin, Youtube, Instagram, and github keep the copyright thing and a list of the current other places that can be clicked to go to another place.

##plan##
1. Review src/components/Footer.jsx to document its current layout, link list, social placeholders, and copyright strip.
2. Determine how to introduce the brand logo (logo.svg) within the footer top row without breaking responsive grid behaviour.
3. Replace the existing social placeholders with icons(links) for X, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, and GitHub, ensuring accessible labels.
4. Preserve and refresh the navigation link grid and copyright line so existing destinations remain available.
5. After updates, run npm run dev and visually check the footer on mobile and desktop breakpoints.
